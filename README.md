# data-analysis-on-apple-store

In this project, our main objective is to tidy up a dataset sourced from GitHub. The purpose behind this endeavor is to make the dataset more organized, readable, and navigable. Our ultimate aim is to delve into the world of mobile app profiles, particularly focusing on those that hold potential for profitability within the App Store market.

To achieve this, our project encompasses several key tasks. Firstly, we need to clean the dataset, removing any inconsistencies, errors, or irrelevant information that could obscure our analysis. Once the data is cleaned, our next step involves thorough exploration. This entails delving into the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that could be valuable for our analysis.
